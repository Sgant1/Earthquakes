# Earthquakes

Pulling together several GeoJSON attributes onto a Leaflet map that would track earthquakes over the last seven days. I am using live data pulled from several websites and what is represented on this map are a few types of overlays:
- Street
- Satalitte
- Light

There are also three filters that can be added or removed from the maps: 

- Tectonic Plates
- Earthquakes
- Major Earthquakes 

This makes for dynamic map that can be adjusted to the user's needs.
